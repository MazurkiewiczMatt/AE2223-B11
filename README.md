- The description of the process and the functions can be seen in the Overleaf file. 

- To access the functions used in the main files, see tools.py

- The main files with the code are range_vs_angle.py and range_vs_time.py; the main difference between the two is the presence of the slider feature, which is present in range_vs_angle but not in range_vs_time

- Scrap.py contains previous version of the script
